# Harvey 


Harvey is a patient management system for hospitals in remote, disconnected areas. It is an offline, ultra low-cost, portable, and lightweight alternative hospital data management service. Harvey allows health-care professionals to upload and download patient files in areas without an internet connection. Any device with Wi-Fi capabilities can connect to Harvey remotely through a Raspberry Pi hotspot. Patient information and files are stored on an internal database on the Pi.

Harvey emerged from a vision to safely and effectively store important documents in communities without the infrastructure for long range internet services.
